# New One Katya ® 👽 AI 🧠 REChain ®️ 🪐 Blockchain Node Network Protocol bASED on Solidity

## Overview

Welcome to the **New One Katya® 👽 AI 🧠 REChain®️** project! This blockchain node network protocol is built on Solidity, leveraging advanced AI-driven algorithms to enhance the robustness, security, and scalability of decentralized networks. Our protocol is designed to support next-generation decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, providing a foundation for building secure, efficient, and scalable blockchain solutions.

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Network Optimization
The protocol incorporates AI-driven optimization techniques that dynamically adjust network parameters to maintain high performance, security, and decentralization. This ensures the network remains resilient under varying conditions, such as fluctuating transaction loads and potential security threats.

### 2. Solidity-Based Smart Contracts
New One Katya® is built on Solidity, the most widely adopted programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum-compatible blockchains. This allows for seamless integration with existing tools, frameworks, and dApps within the Ethereum ecosystem.

### 3. REChain®️ Node Network
The REChain®️ network is a distributed, decentralized node network that underpins the New One Katya® protocol. Nodes participate in consensus, transaction validation, and smart contract execution, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the blockchain.

### 4. Scalability and High Throughput
Through innovative consensus mechanisms and layer-2 solutions, our protocol is designed to handle high transaction volumes without compromising speed or security. This makes it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from DeFi platforms to supply chain management systems.

### 5. Enhanced Security
Security is at the core of the New One Katya® protocol. We employ advanced cryptographic techniques and AI-based threat detection to safeguard the network from malicious attacks, ensuring the safety of user assets and data.

### 6. Interoperability
The protocol is designed with interoperability in mind, allowing seamless communication and integration with other blockchain networks and protocols. This facilitates cross-chain transactions and expands the potential use cases for dApps built on New One Katya®.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Solidity Development Environment**: Ensure you have Solidity installed along with a suitable IDE like Remix or Visual Studio Code.
- **Node.js**: Required for running scripts and managing dependencies.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone ''''
   cd ''''

## Compile

Copy `example.env` to a new file called `.env` and fill the values in it.

```
npx hardhat compile
```

## Test

```
npx hardhat test
```

## Deploy $RECH Token

Run:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-token.ts --network [Your Network]
```

## Deploy Vesting

Don't forget to paste $RECH token address to `.env` variable `$RECH`
Run:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-vesting.ts --network [Your Network]
```
